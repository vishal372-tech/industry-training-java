# Single Inheritance Example in Java

This example demonstrates **single inheritance** in Java, where one class inherits properties from another class using the `extends` keyword.

---

## Java Code Example

```java
class Employee {
    float salary = 40000;
}

class Programmer extends Employee {
    int bonus = 10000;

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Programmer p = new Programmer();
        System.out.println("Programmer salary is: " + p.salary);
        System.out.println("Bonus of Programmer is: " + p.bonus);
    }
}
```

---

## Explanation

### 1. Parent Class (`Employee`)

The `Employee` class contains a data member `salary`, which represents the basic salary of an employee.

### 2. Child Class (`Programmer`)

The `Programmer` class **extends** the `Employee` class. This means:

* `Programmer` automatically gets access to the `salary` field of `Employee`.
* It also has its own data member `bonus`.

### 3. Object Creation

```java
Programmer p = new Programmer();
```

An object of the child class is created. This object can access:

* Its own members (`bonus`)
* Inherited members (`salary`)

### 4. Output Statements

The program prints both the inherited salary and the programmer’s bonus.

---

## Key Concepts Covered

* Inheritance using `extends`
* IS-A relationship (`Programmer` is an `Employee`)
* Code reusability
* Accessing inherited members

Inheritance helps reduce code duplication and makes programs easier to maintain.

# Hierarchical Inheritance Example in Java

This example demonstrates **hierarchical inheritance** in Java, where multiple child classes inherit from a single parent class. It also highlights method accessibility based on object type.

---

## Java Code Example

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("eating...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("barking...");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    void meow() {
        System.out.println("meowing...");
    }
}

class TestInheritance3 {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Cat c = new Cat();
        c.meow();
        c.eat();
        // c.bark(); // Compile-time error
    }
}
```

---

## Explanation

### 1. Parent Class (`Animal`)

The `Animal` class defines a common behavior `eat()` that is shared by all animals.

### 2. Child Classes (`Dog` and `Cat`)

* Both `Dog` and `Cat` extend the `Animal` class.
* This means both classes inherit the `eat()` method.
* Each child class also defines its own specific behavior:

  * `Dog` → `bark()`
  * `Cat` → `meow()`

### 3. Object Creation and Method Access

```java
Cat c = new Cat();
```

The object `c` can access:

* Its own method (`meow()`)
* Inherited method (`eat()`)

It **cannot** access methods of sibling classes (`bark()`), which results in a compile-time error.

---

## Key Concepts Covered

* Hierarchical inheritance
* Code reuse through a common parent class
* Method accessibility based on reference type
* Compile-time error for invalid method calls

Hierarchical inheritance helps organize related classes while sharing common functionality efficiently.

# Multilevel Inheritance Example in Java

This example demonstrates **multilevel inheritance** in Java, where a class inherits from another class, which itself inherits from a third class. It shows how methods are passed down through multiple levels of inheritance.

---

## Java Code Example

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("eating...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("barking...");
    }
}

class BabyDog extends Dog {
    void weep() {
        System.out.println("weeping...");
    }
}

class TestInheritance2 {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        BabyDog d = new BabyDog();
        d.weep();
        d.bark();
        d.eat();
    }
}
```

---

## Explanation

### 1. Base Class (`Animal`)

The `Animal` class defines a common behavior `eat()`.

### 2. Intermediate Class (`Dog`)

The `Dog` class extends `Animal` and:

* Inherits the `eat()` method
* Adds its own behavior `bark()`

### 3. Derived Class (`BabyDog`)

The `BabyDog` class extends `Dog` and:

* Inherits both `eat()` and `bark()` methods
* Adds a new behavior `weep()`

### 4. Object Creation and Method Calls

```java
BabyDog d = new BabyDog();
```

The object `d` can access methods from:

* Its own class (`weep()`)
* Parent class (`bark()`)
* Grandparent class (`eat()`)

---

## Key Concepts Covered

* Multilevel inheritance
* IS-A relationship across multiple levels
* Method accessibility through inheritance
* Code reuse and hierarchical class design

Multilevel inheritance helps build complex behavior by extending existing classes step by step.

# Why Multiple Inheritance Is Not Supported in Java (Class Example)

This example explains **why Java does not support multiple inheritance using classes**. It highlights the ambiguity that can arise when two parent classes contain methods with the same signature.

---

## Java Code Example (Hypothetical)

```java
class A {
    void msg() {
        System.out.println("Hello");
    }
}

class B {
    void msg() {
        System.out.println("welcome");
    }
}

class C extends A, B { // suppose if it were allowed
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        C obj = new C();
        obj.msg(); // Which msg() should be called?
    }
}
```

> ⚠️ **Note:** This code will not compile in Java because multiple inheritance using classes is not allowed.

---

## Explanation

### The Problem: Method Ambiguity

Both class `A` and class `B` define a method with the same signature:

```java
void msg()
```

If Java allowed class `C` to extend both `A` and `B`, the compiler would not know:

* Whether to call `A.msg()` or
* Whether to call `B.msg()`

This situation is known as the **Diamond Problem** or **ambiguity problem**.

### Why Java Avoids This

To keep the language simple and avoid confusion, Java **does not support multiple inheritance with classes**.

---

## How Java Solves This Problem

Java supports multiple inheritance using **interfaces**, not classes.

* A class can implement multiple interfaces.
* Interfaces do not cause ambiguity because methods are either:

  * Implemented by the class, or
  * Resolved using default method rules.

---

## Key Points

* Java does **not** allow multiple inheritance with classes.
* This prevents ambiguity and complexity.
* Multiple inheritance is achieved safely using **interfaces**.

Understanding this concept is important for designing clear and maintainable object-oriented programs in Java.
