# Exception Handling in Java – Common Patterns and Examples

This document covers the most commonly used **exception handling constructs in Java**, explained with simple and practical code snippets. These patterns are frequently asked in **exams, interviews, and real-world applications**.

---

## 1. Basic `try-catch` Block

Used to handle runtime errors and prevent abnormal program termination.

```java
try {
    int result = 10 / 0;
}
catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("Error: Division by zero!");
}
```

### Explanation

* Code that may cause an exception is placed inside `try`.
* `ArithmeticException` is thrown when division by zero occurs.
* Control is transferred to the matching `catch` block.

---

## 2. `try-catch-finally` Block

The `finally` block always executes, whether an exception occurs or not.

```java
try {
    int result = 10 / 0;
}
catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("Error: Division by zero!");
}
finally {
    System.out.println("Execution completed.");
}
```

### Key Point

* `finally` is commonly used for **resource cleanup** such as closing files or database connections.

---

## 3. Nested `try-catch`

A `try-catch` block inside another `try` block.

```java
try {
    try {
        int result = 10 / 0;  // Inner exception
    }
    catch (ArithmeticException e) {
        System.out.println("Inner catch: Division by zero.");
    }
}
catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println("Outer catch: General exception.");
}
```

### Explanation

* Inner `catch` handles the specific exception.
* Outer `catch` executes only if the exception is not handled inside.

---

## 4. User-Defined (Custom) Exception

Creating your own exception by extending the `Exception` class.

```java
class InvalidAgeException extends Exception {
    public InvalidAgeException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

---

## 5. Throwing a Checked Exception using `throws`

```java
void checkAge(int age) throws InvalidAgeException {
    if (age < 18) {
        throw new InvalidAgeException("Age must be 18 or above.");
    }
}
```

### Explanation

* `throws` declares the exception.
* Caller must handle or re-declare the exception.

---

## 6. Throwing an Unchecked Exception

```java
void checkAge(int age) {
    if (age < 18) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Age must be 18 or above.");
    }
}
```

### Key Difference

* Unchecked exceptions do **not** require `throws` declaration.

---

## 7. Multiple `catch` Blocks

Used when different exceptions need different handling logic.

```java
try {
    // Code that may throw exceptions
}
catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
catch (SQLException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

---

## Summary of Concepts

* `try` → code that may cause an exception
* `catch` → handles the exception
* `finally` → always executes
* `throw` → explicitly throws an exception
* `throws` → declares exceptions
* Custom exceptions improve readability and control

---

## Exam Tip

* Checked exceptions → handled at compile time
* Unchecked exceptions → handled at runtime
* `finally` executes even if `return` is present

---

This collection of patterns forms the foundation of exception handling in Java.
